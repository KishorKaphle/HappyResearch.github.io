### Readings with note-taking of Texts in Computer Science Compute Vision Algorithm and Applications by Richard Szeliski

This book is basically an abstract of Prof. Szeliski's knowledge and experience gained over 20 years in corporate research labs, mainly at Digital Equipment Corporation's Cambridge Research Lab and at Microsoft Research. Therefore, this book is going to be more real-world problem focused than merely theories.
