## Welcome to My Science Diary!

In this website, I take and make note of science work, mainly research papers, books, articles reading. This site is soley intended to be pesonal use. The author of this site (which is luckly me) does not hold any obligation on the authentication of any writing presented below. 

Happy Research!

## Date Feb 3:
Paper reading: Dielectrophoretic high-purity isolation of primary T-cells in samples contaminated with leukemia cells, for biomanufacturing of therapeutic CAR T-cells (https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/abc2f3)

### Dielectrophoresis:
Phenomenon in which a force is exerted on a dielectric particle when it is subjected to a non-uniform electric field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectrophoresis). They show dielectrophoresis irrespective of their charging state. 
### Dielctric:
Basically they are electric insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. ![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Capacitor_schematic_with_dielectric.svg/220px-Capacitor_schematic_with_dielectric.svg.png)
